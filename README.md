# Raddle
Extensible Document Manipulation Language for the Web

See https://github.com/wshager/raddled.git for definition files.


## What's this?

Raddle is a rad new language for manipulating structured documents on the web. It is fully-featured, functional, point-less, URL-encodable, type-safe and free as beer.

### Fully-featured

The Raddle core implements the entire W3C XPATH 3.0 specification and then some.

### Functional

Raddle has all the good things from functional programming, including respect for immutability, higher-order functions, abstraction, recursion and referential transparency.

### Point-less

You can't declare variables in Raddle, as you won't need them.

### URL-encodable

Raddle is inspired by RQL, and has the same notation. If you're already familiar with RQL you can start hacking right away.

### Type-safe

With Raddle's type declarations, types are kept in check.


## Why's this?

RQL is a great tool for querying JSON, but with Raddle you can extend that greatness! It is capable of handling more types than arrays of objects, and you can add new functionality, either inline or from external modules.
